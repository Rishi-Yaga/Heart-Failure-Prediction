# ❤️ Heart Failure Prediction using R & Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages R and Machine Learning techniques to predict heart failure risk using clinical and demographic patient data, aiming to support early diagnosis and reduce hospital readmissions.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlight

- Early detection of heart failure remains challenging due to complex clinical indicators and delayed diagnosis.  
- Develop a predictive model in R to classify patients at high risk of heart failure using structured healthcare data.  
- Performed data preprocessing and exploratory analysis in R, handled missing values, and trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models using caret with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Achieved **86%+ accuracy**, identified critical risk predictors, and delivered an interpretable ML framework to assist data-driven clinical decision-making.
